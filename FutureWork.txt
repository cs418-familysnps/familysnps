This project was for a CS418 Bioinformatics class at Brigham Young University. Currently, the project would benefit from future work, including:

-change VariantPhaser.py so that it ignores case when comparing nucleotides.

-change VariantPhaser.py so that the algorithm can phase variants where the child has 2 different variants (see the comment in the code).

-reducing the memory requirement: The phaser must check the human reference genome at the specified location to determine whether a reported genotype
	is actually a SNP. Maybe there is a web service that could be used; it would be a trade-off between memory effeciency and offline use. Also, 
	the VCF files are very large and a lot of the data in them gets thrown away.

-rewriting the algorithm code in C: for faster execution inside the variant phaser code.

-improve TestDriver.py, the tests that we have are not very comprehensive or flexible.
